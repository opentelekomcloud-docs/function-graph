Overview
========

Welcome to FunctionGraph. FunctionGraph hosts and computes event-driven functions in a serverless context while ensuring high availability, high scalability, and zero maintenance. All you need to do is write your code and set conditions. You pay only for what you use and you are not charged when your code is not running.

This document describes how to use application programming interfaces (APIs) to perform operations on FunctionGraph resources, such as creating, deleting, query, and executing functions. For details about all supported operations, see :ref:`API Overview <functiongraph_06_1500>`.
