Does FunctionGraph Support Function Extension?
==============================================

FunctionGraph has integrated non-standard libraries such as redis, http, and obs_client. You can directly use these libraries when developing functions.

Alternatively, use your own dependencies. For more information, see :ref:`Dependency Management <functiongraph_01_0391>`.
