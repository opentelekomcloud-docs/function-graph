Which Permissions Are Required for an IAM User to Use FunctionGraph?
====================================================================

If you are prompted insufficient permissions when creating, deleting, modifying, or querying functions and triggers in FunctionGraph as an IAM user, contact the administrator to grant permissions to your user group. If you want to invoke other cloud services, such as OBS, configure an agency with the required permissions. For security purpose, do this by following the principle of least privilege.
