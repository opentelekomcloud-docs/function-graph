Do I Need to Apply for Any Compute, Storage, or Network Services When Using FunctionGraph?
==========================================================================================

When using FunctionGraph, you do not need to apply for or pre-configure any computing, storage, or network services, but need to upload and run code in supported runtimes. FunctionGraph provides and manages underlying compute resources, including server CPUs, memory, and networks. It performs configuration and resource maintenance, code deployment, automatic scaling, load balancing, secure upgrade, and resource monitoring.
