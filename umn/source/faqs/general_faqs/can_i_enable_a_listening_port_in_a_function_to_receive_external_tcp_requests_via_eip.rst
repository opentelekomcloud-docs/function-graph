Can I Enable a Listening Port in a Function to Receive External TCP Requests via EIP?
=====================================================================================

No. FunctionGraph does not support this feature currently. Functions are about serverless computing, and compute resources are allocated while functions are running. Customizing a listening port is not suitable.
