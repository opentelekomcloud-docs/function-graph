Can I Set the Domain Name of an API to My Own Domain Name?
==========================================================

Yes. The procedure is as follows:

#. Log in to the APIG console and bind a domain name by referring to section "Binding a Domain Name" in the *API Gateway User Guide*.
#. On the **Domain Names** tab page of the created API group, click **Bind Independent Domain Name**. For example, set **xxxx.apig.x** to **test.com/user/get**.
