Can I Create an OBS Trigger with an Existing Bucket?
====================================================

Yes. If a message is displayed indicating that the configuration of the current trigger conflicts with that of another one, the two triggers have the same bucket, prefix, and suffix. If you still want to use this bucket for the current trigger, modify the prefix or suffix.
