What Are the Precautions for Using a Dependency?
================================================

-  The name of each file in a dependency cannot end with a tilde (~).
-  There should be no more than 30,000 files in a dependency.
-  You can upload a ZIP dependency file within 10 MB on the function details page. For a larger dependency (max. 300 MB), upload it using OBS.
-  If your function uses a large private dependency, increase the timeout by choosing **Configuration** > **Basic Settings** on the function details page.
