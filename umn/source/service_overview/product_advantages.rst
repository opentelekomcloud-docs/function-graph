Product Advantages
==================

No Servers to Manage
--------------------

FunctionGraph automatically runs your code and frees you from provisioning and managing servers, allowing you to focus on business innovation.

Auto Scaling
------------

FunctionGraph automatically scales to suit fluctuations in resource demands and ensures that the service remains accessible even during peaks and spikes.

It automatically scales in/out resources based on the number of service requests, and distributes requests to function instances through automatic load balancing.

In addition, the system intelligently preheats instances for the traffic loads to reduce the impact of cold start on your services.

Event-based Triggering
----------------------

FunctionGraph integrates with multiple cloud services using an event-based triggering mechanism to meet service requirements.

It is interconnected with the LTS and Cloud Eye services, allowing you to view function logs and metrics without the need for any configurations.

High Availability
-----------------

If an instance becomes faulty, FunctionGraph starts another instance to process new requests and releases resources from the unhealthy instance.

Pay per Use
-----------

You will be billed based on the number of function requests and execution duration and will not be charged when your code is not running.

Reserved Instance Billing
-------------------------

Reserved instances can be created to initialize functions to eliminate the influence of cold start on your services. Reserved instances are always alive in the execution environment.

For the use of reserved instances, you will be billed based on the number of requests and the running duration of reserved instances. The minimum running duration is 60s.

Dynamic Resource Adjustment
---------------------------

Resource specifications can be dynamically adjusted to minimize resource usage and reduce costs.
