Synchronous Invocation
======================

When triggering a function, clients wait for the result before proceeding. Currently, functions with APIG (dedicated) triggers are executed synchronously. Alternatively, you can use the API described insection "Executing a Function Synchronously" to trigger a function synchronously. In this scenario, a function is executed for up to 15 minutes.
