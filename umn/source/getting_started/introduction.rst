Introduction
============

General Procedure
-----------------

FunctionGraph allows you to run your code without provisioning or managing servers, while ensuring high availability and scalability. All you need to do is upload your code and set execution conditions, and FunctionGraph will take care of the rest. In addition, you pay only for what you use and you are not charged when your code is not running.

To quickly create a function using FunctionGraph, do as follows:
